### Get All Tasks
GET http://localhost:8080/api/tasks
Accept: application/json

---

### Get Task by ID (Using /task/{id})
# Replace {id} with an actual task ID, e.g., 1
GET http://localhost:8080/api/tasks/task/1
Accept: application/json

### Get Task by ID (Using /{id}) - Better practice for single resource retrieval
# Note: Your controller has both /task/{id} and /{id} for GET by ID.
# This one aligns better with common REST practices.
# Replace {id} with an actual task ID, e.g., 1
GET http://localhost:8080/api/tasks/1
Accept: application/json

---
